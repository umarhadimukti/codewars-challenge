// You drop a ball from a given height. After each bounce, the ball returns to some fixed proportion of its previous height. If the ball bounces to height 1 or less, we consider it to have stopped bouncing. Return the number of bounces it takes for the ball to stop moving.

// bouncingBall(initialHeight, bouncingProportion)

// boucingBall(4, 0.5)
// After first bounce, ball bounces to height 2
// After second bounce, ball bounces to height 1
// Therefore answer is 2 bounces

// boucingBall(30, 0.3)
// After first bounce, ball bounces to height 9
// After second bounce, ball bounces to height 2.7
// After third bounce, ball bounces to height 0.81
// Therefore answer is 3 bounces
// Initial height is an integer in range [2,1000]
// Bouncing Proportion is a decimal in range [0, 1)

const bouncingBall = (initial, proportion, n = 0) => {
  if (initial <= 1) return n;
  initial *= proportion;
  n += 1;
